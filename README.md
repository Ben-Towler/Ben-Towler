### Hey, I'm Ben Towler ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer who is passionate about developing engaging, performant and test driven software applications. With over 8 years agency experience, I have a proven background in delivering high quality projects in a time critical environment. 

### Currently working on:
#### Senja (Launch fall 2020)
Senja aims simplify project management for small development teams. Users can easily track project progress, create tasks and share projects with team members. The front-end has been developed with React with Jest testing. The server has been built with Express and we use a MongoDB with Mongoose ORM.

The site is fully responsive, SEO optimised and includes a dark mode! Secure login is handled with JWT, Bcrypt and PassPort.
